This project serves two purposes:
1. Learn more about android programming
2. Create something at least semi-useful

The initial code is crap.  It was hacked together based on [this](http://quietcode.com/clock/) javascript and it is incomplete.

The goal is to have several visualizations of the current time and allow the user to dynamically switch between them.  On the way we will explore some of the core android apis.
